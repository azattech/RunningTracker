/* Why we extends form LifecycleService?
* we will need to observe from life to the objects inside of this service class
* The observed function of a live data object needs the lifecycle owner
* and if we don't specify this LifecycleService() here we can't pass
* an instance of this service as lifecycle owner to that observed function
*
* We want to manage the communication from our activity to our service so on
* the one hand we have the activity to service communication or fragment to
* service communication and for that we will simply use intents, so whenever
* we want to send a command to our service then we will simply send an intent
* to that service with an action attached and inside of this service class then check
* what that action is.
*
* Also we need to worry about the communication from our service to our
* TrackingFragment because we need to to coordinate of the user data.
* SoÄ± that we basically have two major options to do that.
* One option is Singleton pattern.
* The other option would be to make this service a bound service so that
* basically means that the service acts as kind of server and clients can
* bind to it so the client would be our fragment in this case but
* that is much more work and Singleton pattern makes this really much easier.
